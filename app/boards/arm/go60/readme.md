## MoErgo Go60

This board definition provides ZMK support for the [MoErgo Go60](https://www.moergo.com)
keyboard.

MoErgo additionally offers a customized version of ZMK which adds additional functionality such as
RGB status indicators, available on GitHub at [moergo-sc/zmk](https://github.com/moergo-sc/zmk). The
MoErgo customized ZMK fork is regularly updated to include the latest changes from mainline ZMK, but
will not always be completely up-to-date. MoErgo also offers an online layout configurator and
firmware builder application using the customized fork at [my.go60.com](https://my.go60.com).

While mainline ZMK is expected to work well with Go60, MoErgo only provides support for use of
their customized fork. Likewise, the ZMK community cannot directly provide support for MoErgo's fork.
